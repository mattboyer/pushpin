#Pushpin

Pushpin is a simple [add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/about) for [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/fx/) that provides one-click, fire-and-forget bookmarking for [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in).

Pushpin uses the [Pinboard API](https://pinboard.in/api/) and does not require an open session on the Pinboard site. In other words, you may be logged out of Pinboard but adding a bookmark is still exactly one click away.
